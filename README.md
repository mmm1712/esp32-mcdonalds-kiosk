# esp32-mcdonalds-kiosk
I recreated a McDonald’s-style ordering kiosk on the ESP32 with unique menu items from Japan. This project was inspired by ordering at McDonald’s in Tokyo and wanting to bring that experience to an esp32 device.

 Features: 
	ILI9341Touchscreen UI with multi-page navigation
	•	ADD / ADDED interactive buttons
	•	Dynamic total calculation
	•	Checkout screen displaying selected items
	•	“Place Order” button leading to a confirmation screen
	•	Japanese “ありがとうございました” order message
	•	All images converted to RGB565 .h files for embedded displays

  Hardware:
	•	2.8" ESP32 Touchscreen Module (ILI9341 + XPT2046) 

  All PNG/JPG images were converted to .h files using RGB565 format

  Notes:
  •	McDonald's API is private so real orders cannot be sent
	•	This project is for educational and entertainment purposes
